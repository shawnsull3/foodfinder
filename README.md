# Overview

This site allows users to find and filter through a list of restaurants obtained from an external API request. The resturants can be filtered by a search term, which searches the restaurant's name, city and genres. Addtionally the results can be filtered by state, genre or a combination of all three. A specific restaurant can be clicked on to see extra details such as hours, address, and attire. Enjoy!
